# Putting It Together

In this lesson, we will put together everything we have learned so far to sketch the graph of a function in 3D. Examples in this section are slightly more challenging. We recommend that you study and understand the worked examples and the application problem very well before you move on to the practice problems.

Let's start with a straightforward example.

## Example 1

Answer the following questions for the function  $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2−4(x+y)$.

**a.** Find the **range** of $f$ to determine what values $z = f(x,y)$ can assume.

First note that the domain of  $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2−4(x+y)$  is  $x∈(−∞,∞) $ and $ y∈(−∞,∞)$  since any values of  $x$  and  $y$  can be inputted into $f(x,y)$.

To find the range, we rearrange $f$ by completing to square,

$$
f(x,y)=x^2+y^2−4(x+y)=(x^2−4x+4)+(y^2−4y+4)−8=(x−2)^2+(y−2)^2−8
$$
Since  $(x−2)^2+(y−2)^2≥0$ , the range of  $f$  is  $z∈[−8,∞)$.

**b.** Classify the typical **level curves** for $f$.

circles.

Level curves are defined as  $f(x,y)=k$. The level curves will have the general equation of the form  $(x−2)^2+(y−2)^2−8=k$  which simplifies to $(x−2)^2+(y−2)^2=k+8$. Level curves of  $f$  can be classified as a family of circles.

**c.** Classify the typical **cross sections** for $f$ with the planes $x=c$.

parabolas.

**d.** Classify the typical **cross sections** for $f$ with the planes $y=d$.

parabolas.

**e.** Explain how the level curves change as $k$ changes. What does it tell you about the shape of the surface?

For $k=−8$, we get the point $(2, 2)$. For larger values of $k$, we get larger concentric circles centerd at $(2, 2)$.

Note that as $k$ increases, from $−8$ to $13$, the level curves get closer to each other. This means as $k$ increases, the surface is getting steeper.

## Example 2

Answer the following questions for the function  $f(x,y)=e^{1-x^2-y^2}-1$.

**a.** Find the **range** of $f$ to determine what values $z = f(x,y)$ can assume.

First note that the domain of  $f(x,y)=e^{1−x^2−y^2}−1$  is $x∈(−∞,∞)$  and  $y∈(−∞,∞)$  since any values of $x$ and  $y$ can be inputted into $f(x,y)$.

To find the range, we rearrange $f$ in the form that is easier to work with $f(x,y)=e^{1−(x^2+y^2)}−1$.

Let $a=x^2+y^2$ , then we have  $f(a)=e^{1−a}−1$. 

When $a>1$, we get $f(a)=e^{1−a}−1$ and its range is $(−1,0)$.

When $a=1$, we get  $f(1)=1−1=0$.

When $a=0$, we get  $f(0)=e−1$.

When $0<a<1$, we get  $0<a<1⇒−1<−a<0⇒0<1−a<1$.

Since $e^x$ is an increasing function, we get  $e^0<e^1−a<e^1⇒1<e^{1−a}<e⇒0<e^{1−a}−1<e−1$.

Putting it all together, we get the range of $f$ is $(−1,e−1]$.

**b.** Classify the typical **level curves** for $f$.

circles.

Level curves are defined as $f(x,y)=k$. The level curves will have the general equation of the form $e^{1−(x2+y2)}−1=k$ which simplifies to $x^2+y^2=1−ln(k+1)$. Therefore, the level curves of $f$ can be classified as a family of circles.

## Example 3

Answer the following questions for the function  $f(x,y)=2xy-y^2$.

**a.** Find the **range** of $f$ to determine what values $z = f(x,y)$ can assume.

$(-\infty, \infty)$.

**b.** Classify the typical **level curves** for $f$.

First we sketch a few level curves for $k=−2,−1,0,−1,0,1,2$ in the same $xy$-plane.

We observe that level curves are a family of hyperbolas with asymptotes  $y=0$ and $y=2x$ . Note that we get hyperbolae in quadrant 1 and 3 for  $k>0$, and hyperbolae in quadrants 2 and 4 for  $k<0$. For  $k=0 $, we get the asymptotes  $y=0$  and $ y=2x $.

**c.** Classify the typical **cross sections** for f with the planes x=c.
