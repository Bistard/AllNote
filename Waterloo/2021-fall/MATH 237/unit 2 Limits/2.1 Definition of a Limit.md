# Definition of a Limit for Functions of One Variable

Before we define the limit for functions of two variables, let’s recall the limit definition in one variable. 

For a real-valued function $f(x)$ we defined $\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow a}f(x)=L$ to mean that the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$. More precisely, for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
$$
|f(x) - L| < \epsilon, \text{ whenever } 0 < |x-a| < \delta.
$$
and $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a}f(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a^{-}}f(x) = L = \lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a^+}f(x) = L$ 

This means that no matter what $\epsilon > 0$ value we choose, we can always find a corresponding $\delta > 0$ value that would satisfy the following condition
$$
|f(x) - L| < \epsilon, \text{ whenever } 0 < |x-a| < \delta.
$$

# Definition of a Limit for Functions of Two Variables

We define the limit for functions of two variables in a very similar way to the limit of functions of one variable. For a scalar function $f(x, y)$, we want $\lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y)=L$ to mean that the values of $f(x, y)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $(x, y)$ sufficiently close to $(a, b)$.

For multivariable scalar functions our domain is now multidimensional, so we can approach the limit from many directions: in fact, from infinitely many directions! Moreover, we are not restricted to straight lines either; we can approach $(a, b)$ along any smooth curve.

Before we generalize the precise definition of a limit, we need to generalize the concept of an interval.

An open interval is defined as
$$
(-r,r) = \{x:|x|<r\} \text{ where $r\in \mathbb R$}
$$

## Definition: Neighbourhood

> ?	An $r$-neighbourhood of a point $(a,b)\in\mathbb R^2$ is **a set**
> $$
> N_r(a,b) = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2 | ||(x,y) - (a,b)|| < r\}, r\in\mathbb R
> $$
> ![image-20210915170714273](D:\dev\AllNote\.mdnote\assets\image-20210915170714273.png)
>
> Note that if $r<0$, $N_r$ is the empty set.

**remark**

Recall that $||(x,y)-(a,b)$ is the euclidean distance in $\mathbb R^2$. That is,
$$
||(x,y) - (a,b)|| = \sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}
$$

## Definition: Limit

> Assume $f(x,y)$ is defined in a neighbourhood of $(a,b)$, except possibly at $(a,b)$. If, for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
> $$
> 0 < ||(x,y)-(a,b)|| < \delta \text{ implies } |f(x,y) - L| < \epsilon
> $$
> then
> $$
> \lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y)=L
> $$
