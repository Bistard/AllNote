# 1.1.3 Think of what number means



Usually, when faced with a formula to prove, one’s first thought is to prove it by algebraic calculations, or perhaps with an induction argument, or maybe with a combination of the two. But often that is not the easiest way, nor is it the most informative. A much better strategy is one which gives some insight into the meaning of all of the parts of the formula. If we can interpret all the numbers as counting things, addition as “OR”, and multiplication as “AND”, then we can hope to find an explanation of the formula by constructing some objects in the correct way.

This principle – interpreting equations combinatorially and proving the formulas by describing explicit correspondences between sets of objects – is one of the most important and powerful ideas in enumeration. We will apply this way of thinking throughout the first part of these notes.
