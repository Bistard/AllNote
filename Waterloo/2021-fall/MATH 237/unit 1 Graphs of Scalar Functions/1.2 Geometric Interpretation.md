# Geometric Interpretation of $z = f(x, y)$

---

When we graph a function  $y=f(x)$​, we plot points  $(a,f(a))$​  in the  $xy$​-plane. Observe that we can think of  $f(a)$​  as representing the height of the graph  $y=f(x)$  above (or below if negative) the  $x$-axis at  $x=a$.

We define the graph of a function  $f(x,y)$​​  as the set of all points  $(a,b,f(a,b))$​​  in  $\mathbb R^3$​  such that  $(a,b)∈D(f)$​ . We think of  $f(a,b)$​  as representing the height of the graph  $z=f(x,y)$​  above (or below if negative) the  $xy$​-plane at the point  $(x,y)=(a,b)$.

**Example 1**

Let $f$ be defined by $f(x,y)=x+2y+3$. We recognize this as the equation of a plane in $\mathbb R^3$.

In general, when $f$​​ is defined as  $f(x,y)=c_1x+c_2y+c_3$​​, where  $c_1,c_2,c_3$​  are real constants, the graph of  $z=f(x,y)$​  is a plane.

Surfaces  $z=f(x,y)$​ can be quite complicated. To help us visualize and/or sketch these surfaces, we look at 2-dimensional slices of the surface that are called **level curves**.

# Level Curves



## Definition: Level Curves

The level curves of a function $f(x,y)$ are the curves
$$
f(x,y)=k
$$
where the value of $k$​ come from the range $f$.

---

Observe that the level curve $f(x,y)=k$​ is the **intersection** of $z=f(x,y)$ and the horizontal plane $z=k$. Thus, in our family of level curves, each value of $k$ represents the height of that level curve above the $xy$-plane. For this reason, the family of level curves is often called a **contour map** or a **topographic map**.

**Example 2**

Sketch the level curves of $g(x,y)=x^2−y^2$ and use them to sketch the surface $z=g(x,y)$.

We first observe that $D(g)=\mathbb R^2$ and $R(g)=\mathbb R$. For any $k∈R$ we sketch the level curves $x^2−y^2=k$ which we recognize as a family of hyperbolae and their asymptotes $y=±x$ corresponding to $x^2−y^2=0$. Note that we get hyperbolae along the $x$-axis for $k>0$ and hyperbolae along the $y$-axis for $k<0$. For $k=0$, we get the asymptotes $y=±x$.

Using these to sketch the surface, we get a **saddle surface**. (A saddle surface is like the surface of a Pringles chip.)

**Example 3**

Sketch the level curves of $h(x,y)=x^2$ and use them to sketch the surface $z=h(x,y)$​.

We have that $D(h)=\mathbb R^2$ and $R(h)={z∈\mathbb R∣z≥0}$. Thus, for $k≥0$ we have level curves
$$
x^2 = k \Rightarrow x = \pm\sqrt{k}
$$
Hence, the level curves are pairs of vertical straight lines.
For $k=1$​​​​​, we get $x=±1$​​​​​; for $k=\frac{9}{16}$​​​, we get $x=±\frac{3}{4}$​​; for $k=\frac{1}{4}$​​, we get $x=±\frac{1}{2}$​​, and for $k=\frac{1}{16}$​, we get $x=±\frac{1}{4}$.

Using these to sketch the surface, we get a **parabolic cylinder**.

# Cross Sections

## Definition: Cross Sections

A cross section of a surfaces $z=f(x,y)$ is the intersection of $z=f(x,y)$ with a vertical place.

---

For the purpose of sketching the graph of a surface $z=f(x,y)$​​, it is **useful to consider** the cross sections formed by intersecting $z=f(x,y)$​ with the vertical planes $x=c$​ and $y=d$​.

**Example 4**

Let $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$.

The cross sections formed by intersecting $z=f(x,y)$​​ with $x=c$​​ for $c=0,1,2$​​, are:
$z=(0)^2+y^2$, $z=(1)^2+y^2$, and $z=(2)^2+y^2$.

<img src="C:\Users\chrisli\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210910110617044.png" alt="image-20210910110617044" style="zoom:50%;" />

The cross sections formed by intersecting $z=f(x,y)$ with $y=d$ for $d=0,1,2$, are:
$z=x^2+(0)^2$, $z=x^2+(1)^2$, and $z=x^2+(2)^2$.

## Remark

For simplicity, when you are asked to sketch the cross sections of a surface, we mean for you to sketch the **family of cross sections $z=f(c,y)$​​​ and $z=f(x,d)$​​ formed by the intersection of the surface with the vertical planes $x=c$​​ and $y=d$​​**. As in the level curves, the values of $c$ and $d$ can take on multiple values.

**Example 5**

Sketch the cross sections of $g(x,y)=x^2−y^2$​.

For $g(x,y)=x^2−y^2$, we get the following cross sections for $x=c$:

* For $c=0$​, we get $z=(0)^2−y^2$which simplifies to $z=−y^2$.
* For $c=\sqrt{2}$​​​, we get $z=\sqrt{2}^2−y^2$​​ which simplifies to $z=2−y^2$​.
* For $c=-\sqrt{2}$​​​, we get $z=\sqrt{2}^2−y^2$​​which simplifies to $z=2−y^2$​.

For $g(x,y)=x^2−y^2$​, we get the following cross sections for $y=d$:

* For $d=0$​​​, we get $z=x^2−(0)^2$​​which simplifies to $z=−x^2$​​.
* For $d=\sqrt{2}$​​, we get $z=x^2−\sqrt{2}^2$​​ which simplifies to $z=x^2−2$​​.
* For $d=-\sqrt{2}$​​​​, we get $z=\sqrt{2}^2−y^2$​​​which simplifies to $z=2−y^2$​​.

**Example 6**

Sketch the level curves and cross sections of $f(x,y)=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and use them to sketch the surface $z=f(x,y)$.

* **Level Curves**

For $k=1,2$, we get $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=1$ and $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=2$.

# Generalization

When we work with functions of more than two variables, we can generalize the idea of level curves. Introducing an extra variable will also introduce a new dimension. Since we can't visualize 4D, we cannot provide any pictures in this section.



## Definition: Level Surfaces

A Level Surface of a scalar function $f(x,y,z)$ is defined by
$$
f(x,y,z) = k, k \in R(f)
$$

## Definition: Level Sets

A **level set** of a scalar function $f(\vec{x}),\vec{x}\in\mathbb R^n$ is defined by
$$
\{\vec{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f(\vec{x}) = k\}, \text{ for } k\in R(f) 
$$

---

**Example 7**

Let $f$ be defined by:
$$
f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2
$$
The level sets of  $f(\vec{x})=k$, in $\mathbb R^n(k>0)$ are called $(n-1)$**-spheres**, denoted by $S^{n-1}$.
