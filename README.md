## Tutorial 8 - Question 1 - (a)

Given tree $T$ is a connected graph with NO cycles. Let $T_0$ by the subgraph of $T$, by the definition of subgraph, we have $V(T_0) \subseteq V(T)$ and $E(V_0) \subseteq E(T)$ and both endpoints of any edges in $E(T_0)$ are in $V(T_0)$. Then we can conclude that $T_0$ also has NO cycles. Since $T_0$ is also a graph, $T_0$ is a forest follows the definition of forest.
