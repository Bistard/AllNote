# Logic and Computation Introduction



## What is Logic?

<u>Logic</u> is the <u>Science of Reasoning</u>.

* Logic = The science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference 
* Logic = The fundamental science of thoughts and its categories 
* Logic = The science or art of reasoning as applied to a department of knowledge 
* Logic = The analysis and appraisal of arguments

## History of Logic

Aristotle (亚里士多德) (Greek philosopher, 384-322 B.C.) is the first person to offer the outlines of a comprehensive system for codifying and evaluating a wide range of arguments and reasoning.

## Aristotelian logic

* Aristotle: Student of **Plato (柏拉图)** (“Father of Western Philosophy”)

* Aristotle: Tutor of **Alexander the Great (亚历山大大帝)** (356 - 323 B.C.)

* For Aristotle, logic is the instrument by means of which we come to know anything

* Aristotle wrote the earliest known formal study of logic

* For Aristotle, logic is the instrument by means of which we come to know anything

* Aristotle wrote the earliest known formal study of logic

* Formalizes the basic principles of good reasoning, and provides a way to evaluate specific cases of reasoning

* A **syllogism** is a kind of **logical** **argument** in which one proposition (the conclusion) is inferred from two or more others (the premises) of a specific form.

* The following is an example of an Aristotelian syllogism

  1. All humans are mortal.

  2. Socrates is human.

     ————————–

  3. Socrates is mortal.

* The horizontal line separates the premises from the conclusion.

* This syllogism is an example of good reasoning - constitutes a good argument - because it is truth-preserving.

* That is, if the first two sentences (premises) are true, then the third sentence (conclusion) must also be true.

Correctness of an argument depends on <u>form (structure)</u>, not content The argument

The second type of argument is called **hypothetical syllogism**.

**Another Example**

All x are y. 

Some y are z. 

————————– 

Some x are z.

Q: Is this a correct argument?

A: No, This can be seen by the following example of using the argument.

All bunnies are mammals. 

Some mammals are fierce predators.

——————————— 

Some bunnies are fierce predators.

## Why study Logic?

* Most people find logic enjoyable 
* Logic improves one’s general powers of analytical thinking 
* Logic is fundamental to Computer Science

## Applications of logic to computer science

* The underpinnings of all electronic computers are logic gates
* Electronic digital circuits are formed out of logic gates
* Logic can be used for the minimization of the number of components of electronic circuits
* more and more...
