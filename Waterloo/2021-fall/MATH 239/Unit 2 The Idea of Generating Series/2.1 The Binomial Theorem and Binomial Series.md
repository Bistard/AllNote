# 2.1 The Binomial Theorem and Binomial Series

We develop two of the most useful facts that we will need in what follows. The proofs are also good illustrations of calculating with generating series

## Theorem 2.2 (The Binomial Theorem)

This formula is an identity between two polynomials in the variable x. You probably have seen a proof of it by induction on $n$, but we are going to prove it here using <u>the bijection between subsets and indicator vectors</u> discussed in Example 1.12.

### $Proof$

<u>Recall that</u> $\mathcal{P}(n) $ is the set of all subsets of $\{1,2,...,n\}$, and that $\{0,1\}^n$ is the set of all indicator vectors $\alpha = (a_1,a_2,...,a_n)$ in which each coordinate is either 0 or 1. Example 1.12 gives a bijection between these two sets, which you should recall. For example, when $n=8$ the subset $\{2,3,5,7\}$ corresponds to the indicator vector $(0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0)$. The constructions $S \mapsto a(S)$ and $a \mapsto S(a)$ are mutually inverse bijections between the sets $\mathcal{P}(n)$ and ${\{0,1\}}^n$. From this, we concluded that $|\mathcal{P}(n)| = |{\{0,1\}}^n| = 2^n$, but we can deduce more.

Notice that if $S$ is a subset with $k$ elements then it corresponds to an indicator vector $a$ that sums to $k$. It is sometimes helpful to record the information in a little table, like this:
$$
\mathcal{P}(n) \rightleftharpoons {\{0,1\}}^n \\
S \leftrightarrow a = (a_1,a_2,...,a_n) \\
|S| =  a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n.
$$

Because of this bijection, if we introduce an "indeterminate" $x$, and if $S$ corresponds to $a$, then
$$
x^{|S|} = x^{a_1+a_2+...+a_n}
$$
Moreover, also because of this bijection, summing over all subsets is equivalent to summing over all indicator fucntions. That is,
$$
\sum_{S\in\mathcal{P}(n)}x^{|S|} = \sum_{a\in{\{0,1\}}^n}x^{a_1+a_2+...+a_n}.
$$
Now we can simplify both sides separately. On the LHS, we know from theorem 1.5 that there are  $n \choose k$ $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set, for each $0 \leq k \leq n$. Therefore,
$$
\sum_{S\in\mathcal{P}(n)}x^{|S|} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}{n\choose k}x^k.
$$
On the RHS, summing over all the indicator vectors $a \in {\{0,1\}}^n$ is equivalent to summing over all $a_1 \in \{0,1\}$ and all $a_2 \in \{0,1\}$ and so on, ... until all $a_n \in \{0,1\}$. This gives

This proves the Binomial Theorem. With practice and familiarity, it becomes a one-line proof:

## Theorem 2.4 (The Binomial Series)

Consider the set $\mathcal{M}(t)$ of all multisets with $t \geq 1$ types of elements, regardless of the size of the multiset. That is, an element of $\mathcal{M}(t)$ is a sequence $\mu = (m_1,m_2,...,m_t)$ of $t$ natural numbers, and the size of the mutiset is $|\mu| = m_1+m_2+...+m_t$. By Theorem 1.9, for each $n\in\mathbb N$ there are ${n+t-1}\choose{t-1}$ elements of $\mathcal{M}(t)$ of size $n$. By analogy with the Binomial Theorem 2.2, we could collect these numbers as the coefficients of a power series:
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{{n+t-1}\choose{t-1}}x^n
$$
The Binomial Series is an algebraic formula for this summation.

>For any positive integer $t \geq 1$,
>$$
>\frac{1}{(1-x)^t} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{{n+t-1}\choose{t-1}}x^n.
>$$

### $proof$

The key observation is that the set of all multisets with $t \geq 1$ types of elements is $\mathcal{M}(t) = \mathbb N^t$, the Cartesian product of $t$ copies of the natural numbers $\mathbb N$. This leads to a calculation similar to the proof of the Binomial Theorem above, based on this structure:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal{M}(t) &= \mathbb N^t \\
\mu &= (m_1,...,m_t)\\
|\mu| &= m_1 + ... + m_t
\end{align}
$$
We use thi sto calcualte as follows. The first equality is by Theorem 1.9:
