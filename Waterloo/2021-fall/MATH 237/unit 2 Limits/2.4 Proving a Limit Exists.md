# Proving a Limit Exists

As we mentioned earlier, using the precise definition can be quite complicated even for relatively simple limits. Also, we cannot use the previous methods to prove a limit exists. In this section, we introduce a theorem to help us to prove a limit exists.

## Theorem 1: Squeeze Theorem

>If there exists a function $B(x,y)$ such that
>$$
>|f(x,y)-L| \leq B(x,y), \text{ for all } (x,y) \neq (a,b)
>$$
>In some neighborhood of $(a,b)$ and $\lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}B(x,y) = 0$, then
>$$
>\lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y) = L
>$$

The Squeeze Theorem gives us a way to prove that a limit exists by bounding $|f(x, y) − L|$ above by a function $B(x, y)$ whose limit goes to zero. Note that in order to apply the Squeeze Theorem, we need a candidate limit $L$ for the function $f(x, y)$. Once we have the candidate limit, we then need to find a bounding function $B(x, y)$ whose limit is known and goes to zero.

### Proof

Let $\epsilon$ > 0.

Since $\lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}B(x,y) = 0$, by the definition of limit, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
$$
0 < ||(x,y) - (a,b)|| < \delta \text{ imples } |B(x,y) - 0| < \epsilon
$$
Hence, if $0 < ||(x,y) - (a,b)|| < \delta$, then we have
$$
|f(x,y) - L| \leq B(x,y) = |B(x,y)| < \epsilon
$$
as our hypothesis requires that $B(x, y) ≥ 0$ for all $(x, y) \neq (a, b)$ in the neighborhood of $(a, b)$. Therefore, by definition of a limit, we have
$$
\lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y) = L
$$

Determining whether a limit exists and finding limits are, fundamentally, processes of trial and error. As you build experience, you will develop intuitions about what curves to try and which bounding functions to choose.
