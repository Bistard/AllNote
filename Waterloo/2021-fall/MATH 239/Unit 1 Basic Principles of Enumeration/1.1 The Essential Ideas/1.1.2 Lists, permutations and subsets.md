# 1.1.2 Lists, permutations, and subsets

## List

A **list** of a set $S$ is a list of the elements of $S$ exactly once each, in some order. For example, the lists of the set ${1, a, X, g}$ are:

## Permutation

A **permutation** is a list of the set $\{1, 2, 3, ..., n\}$ for some $n \in N$. A permutaiton $\sigma$: $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ can be interpreted as a fucntion $\sigma : \{1,2,...,n\}\rightarrow \{1,2,...n\}$ by putting $\sigma(i) = a_i$ for all $1\leq i \leq n$.

To construct a list of $S$ we can choose any element $v$ of $S$ to be the first element in the list and follow this with any list of the set $S \backslash \{v\}$.

Let $p_n$ denote the number of lists of an $n$-element set $S$. The first sentence of the previous paragraph is translated into the equation:
$$
p_n = p_{n-1}*n
$$
provided that $n$ is positive. (In this equation there are $n$ choices for the first element $v$ of the list, AND $p_{n-1}$ choices for the list of $S \backslash \{v\}$ which follows it.) It is important to note here that each list of $S$ will be produced exactly once by this construction.

## Theorem 1.2

Since it is easy to see that $p_1 = 1$ (and $p_2 = 2$), a simple proof by induction on $n$ shows the following:
$$
\text{Theorem 1.2. For every n } \geq 1, \text{ the number of lists of an n-element set } S \text{ is} \newline
n(n-1)(n-2)\cdot\cdot\cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n!
$$

## Subset

A subset of a set $S$ is a collection of some (perhaps none or all) of the elements of $S$, at most once each and in no particular order.

To specify a particular subset $A$ of $S$, one has to decide for each element $v$ of $S$ whether $v$ is in $A$ or $v$ is not in $A$. That is, we can come up with the next thorem:

## Theorem 1.3

> **Theorem 1.3.** For every $n \geq 0$, the number of subsets of an n-element set $S$ is $2^n$.

## Partial List

A <u>partial list</u> of a set $S$ is a list of a subset of $S$. That is, it is a list of some (perhaps none or all) of the elements of $S$, at most once each and listed in some particular order.

We are going to count partial lists of length $k$ of an $n$-element set.

First think about the particular case $n$ = 6 and $k$ = 3, and the set $S = {a, b, c, d, e, f}$. 

A partial list of $S$ of length 3 is a list $xyz$ of elements of $S$, which must all be different. 

* There are: 6 choices for $x$ (since $x$ is in $S$), AND 
* 5 choices for $y$ (since $y \in S$ but $y \neq x$), AND 
* 4 choices for $z$ (since $z \in S$ but $z \neq x$ and $z \neq y$). 
* Altogether there are 6 · 5 · 4 = 120 partial lists of ${a, b, c, d, e, f}$ of length 3.

This kind of reasoning works just as well in the general case. If $S$ is an $n$-element set and we want to construct a partial list $v_1,v_2,...v_n$ of elements of $S$ of length $k$, then there are:

* $n$ choices for $v_1,$ AND
* $n-1$ choices for $v_2$, AND
* ...
* $n - (k + 2)$ choices for $v_{k-1}$, AND
* $n-(k+1)$ choices for $v_k$.

Then we can come up with the next theorem:

## Theorem 1.4

> **Theorem 1.4.** For $n, k > 0$, the number of partial lists of length $k$ of an $n$-element set is:
> $$
> n(n - 1)···(n - k + 2)(n - k + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
> $$
> 

We next count subsets of an $n$-element set $S$ which have a particular size $k$. So for $n, k \geq 0$ let $n \choose k$ denote the number of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set $S$. 

To count $k$-element subsets of $S$ we consider another way of constructing a partial list of length $k$ of $S$.

To do so, **we can choose a $k$-element subset $A$ of $S$ AND a list of $A$**. Since every partial list of length $k$ of $S$ is constructed exactly once in this way, by Theorem 1.2, this translates into the equation
$$
{n \choose k} \cdot k! = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.
$$
## Theorem 1.5

In summary we have proved the following result

> **Theorem 1.5.** For $0 \leq k \leq n$, the number of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set is
> $$
> {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
> $$
>
> 

The numbers $n \choose k$ reads as 'n choose k', and are called '**binomial coefficients**'.
