# 2.5 Appendix Inequalities and Absolute Values



## Appendix: Inequalities and Absolute

Values When finding multivariable limits, we often make use of inequalities and absolute values. This section gathers some commonly used results for you to refer to. 

The following statements can be taken as axioms ($$i.e.$$, assumed properties) which define the notion of “less than” (denoted “$<$”) for real numbers. One can equivalently use the notion of “greater than”) (denoted “$>$”). The statement “$a > b$” means “$b < a$”. 

* <u>Trichotomy</u> <u>Property</u>: For any real numbers a and b, one and only one of the following holds: 
  $$
  a = b, a < b, b < a
  $$
  
* <u>Transitivity Property</u>: If $a < b$ and $b < c$, then $a < c$. 

* <u>Addition</u> <u>Property</u>: If $a < b$, then for all $c$, $a + c < b + c$. 

* <u>Multiplication</u> <u>Property</u>: If $a < b$ and $c < 0$, then $bc < ac$. 

* <u>Multiplicative</u> <u>Inverse</u> <u>Property</u>: If $ab > 0$ with $a < b$, then $\frac{1}{b} < \frac{1}{a}$ . Note the change in order!

The absolute value of a real number a is defined by
$$
|a| = 
\begin{cases}
a & \text{if } a\geq 0 \\
-a & \text{if } a < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Some frequently used results, which follow from the definition of the absolute value and from the axioms on inequalities, are listed below. <u>These are commonly used when applying the Squeeze Theorem</u>.

1. $|a| = \sqrt{a^2}$
2. $|a| < b, \text{ if and only if } -b < a < b$.
3. the Triangle Inequality: $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b| \text{ for all } a,b \in \mathbb R$.
4. if $c > 0$, then $a < a + c$.
5. the cosine inequality $2|x||y| \leq x^2 + y^2$.

One particularly common use of (4) is for things like
$$
|x| = \sqrt{x^2} \leq \sqrt{x^2+y^2}.
$$


State whether the statement “If $c>0$ then $|a+c|≤a+c$.” is true or false.
