# 2.2 The Theory in General

In general terms we have a sequence of numbers $g = (g_0, g_1, g_2, ...)$ which we would like to determine. To do this we introduce an <u>indeterminate</u> $x$ and encode these numbers as the coefficients of a power series
$$
G(x) = g_0 + g_1x + g_2x^2 + g_3x^3 + ... = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}g_nx^n
$$
called the <u>generating series</u> for the sequence $g$.

### "indeterminate"

By “indeterminate” we mean that $x$ behaves algebraically as if it were a number, <u>but that it does not have any particular value</u>. 

It should be thought of as a punctuation mark that is there to keep the different coefficients $g_n$ separated from each other. Sometimes, people call $x$ a “variable” – but that word is meant to convey the idea that x is a number, but that we don’t know specifically what the value of that number is. 

The word “indeterminate” is meant to convey the idea that $x$ does not have any value at all – it is just a punctuation mark. As will be seen, it is the coefficients of these power series that carry information about our counting problems.



In this chapter and the next we will see how to use this strategy to encode the answers to various counting problems as generating series. In Chapter 4 we will see how to get numbers out of these power series in order to answer the counting problems explicitly.
