# 1.1.5 Bijective proofs

The arguments above, counting lists, permutations, subsets, multisets, and so on, can be phrased more formally using the idea of bijections between finite sets. In simple cases as we have seen so far this is not always necessary, but it is good style. In more complicated situations, as we will see in Chapters 2 to 4, it is a very useful way to organize one’s thoughts.

## Definitions 1.10

>Let $f: \Alpha \rightarrow \Beta$ be a function from set $A$ to a set $B$.
>
>* The function $f$ is <u>surjective</u> if for every $b \in B$ there exists an $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$.
>* The function $f$ is <u>injective</u> if for every $a, a' \in A$, if $f(a) = f(a')$, then $a = a'$.
>* The function $f$ is <u>bijective</u> if it is both surjective and injective.
>* The notation $A \rightleftharpoons B$ indicates that there is a <u>bijection</u> between the sets $A$ and $B$.

Functions with these properties are called <u>surjections</u>, <u>injections</u>, or <u>bijections</u>, respectively.

An older terminology – now out of fashion – is that <u>surjections are “onto” functions</u>, <u>injections are “one-to-one” functions</u>, and bijections are “one-to-one and onto”.

**The point of the definition 1.10 is the following**.

Consider a bijection $f : A \rightleftharpoons B$. Then every $b \in B$ is the image of at least one $a \in A$, since $f$ is surjective. 

On the other hand, every $b \in B$ is the image of at most one $a \in A$, since $f$ is injective. 

Therefore, every $b \in B$ is the image of exactly one $a \in A$. In other words, the relation $f(a) = b$ pairs off all the elements of $A$ with all the elements of $B$. It follows that $A$ and $B$ have the same number of elements. 

**That is, if $A \rightleftharpoons  B$ then $|A| = |B|$. The converse implication holds, and for infinite sets the relation $A \rightleftharpoons  B$ is taken as the definition of two sets “having the same size”.**

## Proposition 1.11

> <u>Proposition 1.11</u>. Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow A$ be functions between two sets $A$ and $B$. Assume the following.
>
> * For all $a \in A$, $g(f(a)) =a$.
> * For all $b \in B$, $f(g(b)) = b$.
>
> Then both $f$ and $g$ are bijections. Moreover, for $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, we have $f(a) = b$ if and only if $g(b) = a$.

A pair of functions as in Proposition 1.11 are called **<u>mutually inverse bijections</u>** . The notation $g = f^{-1}$ and $f = g^{-1}$ is used to denote this relation. Notice that for a bijection $f$, we have $(f^{-1})^{-1} = f$.
