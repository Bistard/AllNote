# 1.1.4 Multisets

Imagine a bag which contains a large number of marbles of three colors – red, green, and blue, say. The marbles are all indistinguishable from one another except for their colors. There are $N$ marbles of each colour, where $N$ is very, very large (more precisely we should be considering the limit as $N \rightarrow \infty$). If I reach into the bag and pull out a handful of 11 marbles, I will have $r$ red marbles, $g$ green marbles, and $b$ blue marbles, for some nonnegative integers $(r, g, b)$ such that $r + g + b = 11$. How many possibile outcomes are there? 

**The word “<u>multiset</u>” is meant to suggest a set in which the objects can occur more than once.** 

For example, the outcome $(4, 5, 2)$ in the above situation corresponds to the “set” {$R, R, R, R, G, G, G, G, G, B, B$} in which $R$ is a red marble, $G$ is a green marble, and $B$ is a blue marble. This is an $11$-element multiset with elements of three types. The number of these multisets is the solution to the above problem.

## Definition: Multisets

> Definition 1.8. Let $n \geq 0$ and $t \geq 1$ be integers. A multiset of size $n$ with elements of $t$ types is a sequence of nonnegative integers $(m_1, ...,m_t)$ such that (说白了, 就是他妈的element可以有重复QAQ)
> $$
> m_1+m_2+...m_t = n.
> $$

## Theorem 1.9

> Theorem 1.9. For any $n \geq 0$ and $t \geq 1$, the number of $n$-element multsets with elements of $t$ types is
> $$
> {n + t -1}\choose{t-1}
