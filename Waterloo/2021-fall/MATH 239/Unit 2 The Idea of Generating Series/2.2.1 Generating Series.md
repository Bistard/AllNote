# 2.2.1 Generating Series

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set of "objects" which we want to count. The set $\mathcal{A}$ can be quite arbitrary, but we assume that each element of $\mathcal{A}$ has a "<u>size</u>" or "<u>weight</u>" attached to it. The weight of $a \in \mathcal{A}$ is a nonnegative integer $w(a) \in \mathbb N$. We just require that there are only finitely many elements of $\mathcal{A}$ of any given weight.

## Definition: Weight Function

> <u>Definition 2.5</u> Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set. A function $w: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb N$ form $\mathcal{A}$ to the set $\mathbb N$ of natural numbers is a <u>weight function</u> provided that for all $n \in \mathbb N$, the set
> $$
> \mathcal{A_n} = w^{-1}(n) = \{a\in \mathcal{A} : w(a) = n \}.
> $$
> is <u>finite</u>. That is, for every $n \in \mathbb N$ there are only finitely many elements $a \in \mathcal{A}$ of weight $n$.

Notice that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a set with a weight function $w: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb N$, then
$$
\mathcal{A} = \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}\mathcal{A}_n
$$
is a (disjoint) union of countably many finite sets, and so $\mathcal{A}$ is itself either finite or countably infinite.



## Definition: Generating series

><u>Definition 2.6</u> Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set with a weight function $w: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb N$ as in Definition 2.5. The <u>generating series</u> of $\mathcal{A}$ with respect to $w$ is
>$$
>A(x) = \Phi_{\mathcal{A}}^{w}(x) = \sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}x^{w(a)}.
>$$
>

(We usually suppress the superscript from the notation.) Remember â€“ the indeterminate x does not have a value. It is just used to keep track of the weight of each object $a \in \mathcal{A}$ in the exponent.

## Proposition 2.7

>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set with a weight function $w: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb N$ , and let
>$$
>\Phi_{\mathcal{A}}(X) = A_0 + A_1x + A_2x^2 + ... = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n.
>$$
>For every $n\in\mathbb N$, the number of elements of $\mathcal{A}$ of weight $n$ is $a_n = |\mathcal{A}_n|$.

Thus, for each $n \in \mathbb N$, the coefficient of $x^n$ in $\Phi_{\mathcal{A}}(x)$ is <u>the number of elements in $\mathcal{A}$ that have weight $n$</u>.

## Definition 2.8

Since we will be doing a lot of long calculations with power series, and because of Proposition 2.7, it is useful to have a handy notation for extracting coefficients from them.

>Let $G(x) = g_0 + g_1x + g_2x^2 + ... = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}g_nx^n$ be any power series. Then for any $k \in \mathbb N$,
>$$
>[x^k]G(x) = g_k
>$$
>is the coefficient of $x^k$ in the pwoer series $G(x)$.
