# 1.1.7 Combinatorial probabilities

We can interpret counting problems in terms of probabilities by making one additional hypothesis. That hypothesis is that

>every possible outcome is equally likely.

The exact definition of what is an “outcome” depends on the particular problem. If $\Omega$ denotes a finite set of all possible outcomes, then any subset $E$ of $\Omega$ is what a probabilist calls an “event”. The probability that a randomly chosen outcome from $\Omega$ is in the set $E$ is $|E|/|\Omega|$ exactly because every outcome has probability $1/|\Omega|$ of being chosen, and there are $|E|$ elements in $E$. Here are a few examples to illustrate these ideas.
