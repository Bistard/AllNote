# 3.2 The continuity Theorems



## Basic Functions

As we saw in the previous lesson, checking whether a function is continuous can be done by verifying that the definition of continuity is satisfied. This can get a bit tedious, which is why we will now develop some results which will simplify checking for continuity. The general idea is to view a given function as being made up of simpler functions, which we know to be continuous.

<u>We will call these simpler functions basic functions</u>, which are known to be continuous on their domains. In this course, you can take the continuity of these functions on their domains as a given.

*  the constant function $f(x, y) = k$
* the power functions $f(x, y) = x^n, f(x, y) = y^n $$
* the logarithm function $ln(·) $$
* the exponential function $e^{(·)}$
* the trigonometric functions, $sin(·), cos(·)$, etc.
* the inverse trigonometric functions, $arcsin(·)$, etc. 
* the absolute value function $| · |$

Now that we have our list of basic functions, let’s see how we can <u>assemble them into more complicated functions using operations</u>.

## Operations on Functions

> <u>Definition</u>: If $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are scalar functions and $(x,y) \in D(f) \cap D(g)$, then:
>
> 1. the **sum** $f + g$ is defined by 
>    $$
>    (f+g)(x,y) = f(X,y)+ g(x,y)
>    $$
>
> 2. the **product** $fg$ is defined by
>    $$
>    (fg)(x, y) = f(x, y)g(x, y)
>    $$
>
> 3. the **quotient** $\frac{f}{g}$ is defined by
>    $$
>    (\frac{f}{g})(X,y)=\frac{f(X,y)}{g(x,y)}, \text{ if $g(x,y) \neq 0$}.
>    $$

## Composite Functions

> <u>Definition</u>: For scalar functions $g(t)$ and $f(x, y)$ the composite function $g ◦ f$ is defined by 
> $$
> (g ◦ f)(x, y) = g(f(x, y))
> $$
>  for all $(x, y) ∈ D(f)$ for which $f(x, y) ∈ D(g)$.

### Remark

<u>When composing multivariable functions, it is very important to make sure that the range of the inner function is a subset of the domain of the outer function</u>.

## The Continuity Theorems

### The Continuity Theorem 1

With basic functions and operations on functions in hand, we now state and prove a set of theorems to help us more easily prove that a function of two variables is continuous. We will refer to the following theorems collectively as the **continuity theorems**.

> If $f$ and $g$ are both continuous at $(a, b)$, then $f + g$ and $fg$ are continuous at $(a, b)$.

**proof ($f+g$):**

### The Continuity Theorem 2

> If $f$ and $g$ are both continuous at $(a, b)$ and $g(a, b) \neq 0$, then the quotient $\frac{f}{g}$ is continuous at $(a, b)$.

### The Continuity Theorem 3

> If $f(x, y)$ is continuous at $(a, b)$ and $g(t)$ is continuous at $f(a, b)$, then the composition $g ◦ f$ is continuous at$ (a, b)$.

## Applying the Continuity Theorems (examples)

Let’s see how we use basic functions, operations on functions, and the Continuity Theorems to prove that functions are continuous.

However, <u>we cannot always apply the Continuity Theorems</u>. At certain points where the Continuity Theorems cannot be applied, we still have to use the definition of continuity in order to determine whether or not the function is continuous. Here is an example:
