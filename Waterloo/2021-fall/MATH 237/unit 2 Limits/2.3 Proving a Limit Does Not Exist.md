# Proving a Limit Does Not Exist

Recall for a function of one variable, we often showed a limit did not exist by showing the left-hand limit did not equal the right-hand limit and using the fact that the limit must be unique. For multivariable functions, we will essentially do the same thing, only now we have to remember that we are able to approach $(a, b)$ along any smooth curve.

We often can approach the limit along infinitely many lines or smooth curves at the same time **by introducing an arbitrary coefficient $m$**. If the value of the limit depends on the value of $m$, then it is not unique and hence, the limit does not exist.
