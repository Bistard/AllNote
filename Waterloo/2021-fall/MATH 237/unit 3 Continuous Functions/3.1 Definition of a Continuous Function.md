In many situations, we require that a function $f(x, y)$ is <u>continuous</u>. Intuitively, this means that the graph of $f$ (the surface $z = f(x, y)$) has no “breaks” or “holes” in it.

## Definition of a Continuous Function of Two Variables

Here is the formal definition of continuity for a function of two variables.

> <u>Definition</u>: A function $f(x,y)$ is **continuous** at $(a,b)$ if and only if
> $$
> \lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)
> $$
> Additionally, if $f$ is continuous at every point in a set $D \subset \mathbb R^2$, then we say that $f$ is continuous on $D$.

### Remark

Just like in single variable calculus, there are three requirements in this definition:

* $\lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y)$ exists,
* $f$ is defined at $(a,b)$, and
* $\lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)$.

<u>When checking whether a function is continuous</u>, it is important to remember to check each of these conditions. Let’s look at a few examples to see how we apply the definition of continuity in practice.

<u>To show that a function is not continuous</u>, we need to show that at least one of the three requirements of the definition of continuity fails.
