# Scalar Functions

One of the most important concepts in mathematics is that of a function. Before we begin the study of scalar functions, let's review the basic vocabulary about functions in general.

- A function $f:A→B$​​​​ associates with each element $a∈A$​​​ a unique element $f(a)∈B$​ called the **image** of $a$ under $f$​.

- The set $A$ is called the **domain** of $f$​​ and is denoted by $D(f)$​.
- The set $B$ is called the **codomain** of $f$.
- The subset of $B$​ consisting of all $f(a)$​ is called the **range** of $f$ and is denoted $R(f)$.

We will first extend what we did in single variable calculus to functions of several variables. We will usually look at real functions of two variables whose domain is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$​​​​​​ and whose codomain is $\mathbb{R}^2$​​​​​​. That is, we consider functions $f$​​​​​​ which map points $(x,y)∈\mathbb{R}^2$​​​​​​ to a real scalar $f(x,y)∈R$​​​​​. We write $z=f(x,y)$​​​. We will also consider more general functions $f(x_1,…,x_n)$​​ which map subsets of $R^n$​​ to $R$​​.

**Remark**

```text
Although strictly speaking,  f(x,y)  denotes the value of the function f at the point (x,y) , it is common practice to use the phrase “the function  f(x,y) ” to stress which independent variables the function is dependent on.
```

## Definition: Scalar Function

---

A **scalar function** $f(x_1,…,x_n)$​​ of $n$​​ variables is a function whose domain is a subset of $\mathbb R^n$​​ and whose range is a subset of $\mathbb R$​​.

### Remark

We will sometimes use $\vec{x}$​ to represent a point in $\mathbb R ^n$​. Note that there will be several times in the course where it is convenient to view points in $R^n$​ as vectors in $R^n$​ to make use of results from linear algebra.

## Practice

**Example 1**

Let $f$​ be defined by $f(x,y)=2x+3y+1$​. Find $f(1,−4)$ and .

**Solution:**

We have
$$
\begin{align*} f(1,-4)&=2(1) + 3(-4) + 1 = -9\\ f(1,1)&=2(1) + 3(1) + 1 = 6 \end{align*}
$$
# Domain and Range

**example 1**

What is the **domain** of the scalar function $f(x,y)=2x+3y+1$? Enter your answer in interval notation.

**answer**: $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$​

What is the **range** of the scalar function $f(x,y)=2x+3y+1$?

**answer**: The range of $z=f(x,y)=2x+3y+1$ is $(−∞,∞)$ since any real number $z∈R$ can be reached by $f(x,y)$.

**example 2**

Find the domain and range of $f(x, y) = \sqrt{xy}$.

**answer**: domain: $x \leq 0, y \leq 0$​​, $x \geq 0, y\geq 0$​​. For the range, we notice that $f(x,y)=\sqrt{xy}\geq 0$​. To see that the range of $f$ contains all non-negative real numbers, observe that for any non-negative real number $c$ we have that $f(c^2,1)=c^2=|c|=c$.

**example 3**

Find the domain and range of $\displaystyle g(x,y) = \dfrac{x^2 - y^2}{|x| + |y|}$.

Observe $g$ is undefined whenever $(x,y)=(0,0)$. So, the domain is $R^2−\{(0,0)\}$.

The range is a little more difficult to see. We need to determine all values we can get from $g$ by taking points in our domain.

First, let's try to see if $g$ can output all possible positive values. We do so by considering points $(c,0)$, $c≠0$. We get
$$
g(c,0)=\frac{c^2-0^2}{|c|-|0|}=|c|
$$
Hence, $g$ can take any positive value.

Similarly, we check whether $g$ can output all possible negative values using the points $(0,d)$, $d≠0$ which give
$$
g(0,d)=\frac{0^2-d^2}{|0|-|d|}=-|d|
$$
Thus, $g$ can also take any negative value.

Finally, observe that $g(1,1)=0$​​​​. Therefore, the range of $g$​​ is $\mathbb R$​​​.

**Example 4**

$f(x,y) = \ln(1-x^2-y^2)$

The domain of  $f(x,y)$  is  $1−x^2−y^2>0$ . Rearranging, we get  $x^2+y^2<1$​ , which is an open circle of radius 1 center at the origin.

From above, we know that the domain of  $f(x,y)$ is $x^2+y^2<1$ . This means that $f(x,y)$ outputs values  $z≤0$ ; hence the range of  $f(x,y)$ is $z≤0$. 

**Example 5**

$g(x,y) = \sqrt{16-x^2+y^2}$

We cannot input negative values in the square root, so we must have  $16−x^2+y^2≥0$​​​​. Rearranging, we get  $x^2−y^2≤16$​​​ as the domain of  $g(x,y)=\sqrt{16−x^2+y^2}$​.

The function  $g(x,y)=\sqrt{16−x^2+y^2}$​ can only output positive values, so the range of  $g(x,y)$ is $z≥0$​.
