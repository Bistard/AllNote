1.  Translate each of the following English sentences into a formula of propositional logic. Explicitly define the meaning of each proposition symbol that you use in your translation. You do not have to include all the parentheses required by the formation rules of Form($\mathcal{L}^p$), provided the meaning of your formula is clear.

(a). The assignment will be due on Friday even though Friday will not be a working day.

* $p:$ "The assignment will be due on Friday"

* $q:$ "Friday is a working day".
  $$
  p \rightarrow \neg q
  $$
  

(b). It is beach weather if it is sunny and warm.

* $p:$ be "beach weather"
* $q:$ "sunny"
* $z:$ "warm":

$$
(q \and z) \rightarrow p
$$

(c). You will learn the course material provided you read either the course notes or the textbook.

* $p:$ read the course notes
* $q:$ "read the textbook"
* $z:$ be "learn the course material provided"

$$
(p \or q) \rightarrow z
$$

(d). To get a driver’s license it is both necessary and sufficient, to pass the written test and to pass the road test.

* $p:$ get a driver's license
* $q:$ pass the written test
* $z:$ pass the road test

$$
p \rightarrow (q \and z)
$$

(e). your guitar will sound good only if your tune it before you play it.

* $p:$ guitar sounds good
* $q:$ tune my guitar before play it

$$
p \leftrightarrow q
$$

(f). I will plant beans or carrots in my garden, but not both.

* $p:$ plant beans in my garden

* $q:$ plant carrots in my garden
  $$
  (p \and \neg q) \or (\neg p \and q)
  $$

(g). A sufficient condition for you to get hired is that you are able to code in Python.

* $p:$ get hired

* $q:$ able to code in Python
  $$
  p \rightarrow q
  $$

(h).  For you to register to vote, it is necessary that you be a Canadian citizen.

* $p:$ register to vote
* $q:$ be a Canadian citizen

$$
p \rightarrow q
$$

(i). Our baseball team will win the game if and only if the opposing team does not win the game.

* $p:$ baseball team wins the game
* $q:$ the opposing team wins the game

$$
p \leftrightarrow \neg q
$$

(j). This menu offers neither falafel nor sushi.

* $p:$ menu offers falafel
* $q:$ menu offers sushi

$$
(\neg p \and \neg q)
$$





2. Recall the rules of precedence in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) constructions: $¬$ binds more tightly than $∧$, which binds more tightly than $∨$, which binds more tightly than $→$, which binds more tightly than $↔$. 

   Use these precedence rules to fully parenthesize each of the following formulas. You must include all the parentheses required by the formation rules of Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) in each answer.

(a). $p \and \neg q \or r$
$$
((p \and (\neg q)) \or r)
$$
(b). $p → q ↔ r$
$$
((p \rightarrow q) \leftrightarrow r)
$$
(c). $¬p → ¬q ∨ ¬r$
$$
((\neg p) \rightarrow ((\neg q) \or (\neg r)))
$$



3. For each of the following strings of symbols, state whether the string is a formula of Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) or not. Then explain/justify your answer, that is,
   *  if the expression is in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) then give its parse tree, and
   * if the expression is not in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) then prove that the formation rules of Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) CANNOT be used to produce it.

(a). $(¬(p → (q ∧ r)))$

It is in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) and its parse tree looks like this:

<img src="D:\dev\AllNote\.mdnote\assets\image-20210922231032173.png" alt="image-20210922231032173" style="zoom:50%;" />

(b). $((¬p) ↔ (q ∨ r))$

It is in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) and its parse tree looks like this:

<img src="D:\dev\AllNote\.mdnote\assets\image-20210922231252519.png" alt="image-20210922231252519" style="zoom:50%;" />

(c). $(¬ ∧ p(∨q → r))$

$proof$. We prove the formula is NOT in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) by contradiction.

we have $p, q, r$, and these are the atoms in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$). 

$p,q,r$ are atomic formulas in Atom($\mathcal{L}^p$), and thus formulas in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$). But, $(\or q)$ is not in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$) since none of the five formula rules can apply to this. Thus, the formula $(¬ ∧ p(∨q → r))$ is not in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$).



4. Let $A \in Form(\mathcal{L}^p)$ be artbitary and let $A = a_1a_2...a_n$, where each $a_i$ denotes a single symbol: either a proposition symbol, a connective symbol, or a parenthesis.

   Prove by structural induction on $A$ that every two distinct proposition symbols in $A$ have a connective between them. In detail, prove that for every $i < j$, if $a_i$ and $a_j$ are proposition symbols, then there is some $k$, with $i < k < j$, such that the symbol $a_k$ is a connective symbol.

   Clearly explain all parts of your structural induction argument; in particular explicitly state your induction hypotheses.

$proof.$

Let $R(A)$ be the property that any two distinct proposition symbols in $A$ have a connective between them.

Since we are trying to prove a implication, then the length of the formula (including parenthesis) is greater or equal to 5 in order to have at least 2 proposition symbols.

<u>BASE</u>: Let $A$ be some formula that has the minimum length which is 5, then $A$ can only be in the forms of $(p \and q), (p \or q), (p \rightarrow q), (p \leftrightarrow q)$. Since these are the fomula rules in Form($\mathcal{L}^p$), then $R(A)$ holds true.

<u>INDUCTIVE HYPOTHESIS</u>: There are two subcases:

1. $i + 2 = j$. 

2. $i + 2 < j$.
