# 1.1.6 Inclusion/Exclusion

Let $A_1,A_2,...,A_m$ be finite sets. 

We wants a formula for the cardinality of the union of these sets $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_m$. 

> First a bit of notation: if $S$ is a nonempty subset of $\{1, 2, ..., m\}$ then let $A_S$ denote the intersection of the sets $A_i$ for all $i \in S$. So, for example, with this notation we have $A_{\{2,3,5\}}$ = $A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_5$.

## Theorem 1.15

> **Theorem 1.15** (inclusion/exclusion). Let $A_1, A_2, ..., A_m$ be finite sets. Then
> $$
> |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_m| = \sum_{\varnothing\neq S\subseteq\{1,...,m\}}^{}{(-1)^{|S|-1}|A_s|}.

We prove Theorem 1.15 in Section 2.5, but all that is required is the Binomial Theorem 2.2.
